# against the previously executed command.
# For example, if your have just executed:
#   pwd
#   ls foo
#   ls bar
#   pwd
# And then you start typing 'ls', then the suggestion will be 'ls foo',
# rather than 'ls bar', as your most recently executed command (pwd)
# was succeeded by 'ls foo' on it's previous invocation.
